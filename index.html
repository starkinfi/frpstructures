        <div class="w3-container">
          <p style="text-align: justify;">FRP Fiberglass gratings are extensively utilized in walkways, trench covers, stairways, platforms and flooring. Whereas FRP moldeFRPd gratings are used in chemical industries where oils and chemicals are highly utilized. It is an industrial product that one can avail at lower prices from manufacturers. FRP pultruded gratings are highly used in offshore rig plants, power plants, oil and gas industry and in various architectural structures.FRP heavy-duty gratings are suited for water treatment plants, food industries, chemical factories, and more.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Fiberglass reinforced plastic grating (also known as FRP grating, glass reinforced plastic grating or fiberglass grating) is a composite material manufactured by combining a matrix of resin and fiberglass. Fiberglass grating does not corrode like steel grating and is therefore used in corrosive environments to reduce maintenance costs. It is used in a variety of applications including walkways and overhead platforms. FRP grating is a structural product that can be weight-bearing between spans.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">In electrically hazardous environments: FRP grating is often used in electrically hazardous environments because it is non-conductive. It therefore reduces the risk of electric shock or other injuries in the event of an accident involving electricity.</p>

          <h2 class="w3-opacity"><b>What is an FRP Ladder?</b></h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">FRP is manufactured by the pultrusion process which is a continuous moulding procedure. This process is so effective that the composite made using pultrusions becomes very strong. The FRP does not allow the bending of the structure. So, the FRP ladders are safe to use as they can withstand the heavy weight of traffic. They do not get damaged and so the ladders last for longer.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">FRP Ladders are commonly used in industrial settings to provide access to elevated locations or to allow for safe exits in case of an emergency. The need for a reliable, durable, and resistant ladder makes choosing a fiberglass reinforced plastic ladder from Marco Specialty Steel a great idea.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The ladders are common in electrical industries. The electricians have to deal with electrical wires and high electricity. It is very important to maintain the safety of electricians from electrical shocks. So in this case FRP ladders are best to use in industry as they are resistant to electricity. And also the workers can work in a safe environment.</p>

        <div class="w3-container">
          <h2 class="w3-opacity"><b>What are the benefits of using FRP grating and ladders?</b></h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Working with flammable materials: FRP grating doesn't give off any sparks, so it is often seen as a safer alternative to steel or other metals around flammable materials. For example, dropping metal objects on it would not create sparks, potentially causing atmospheric gases around it to ignite.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">On complex construction sites: the ease of transporting, storing and cutting FRP grating makes it a flexible and cost-effective solution for site work. Construction firms are able to use standard cutting tools to make FRP grating fit complicated and fluid site layouts.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The multi-directional strength of moulded FRP grating means cut-outs to make room for pipework or to navigate complex flooring layouts that don't need extra reinforcement. Another advantage of moulded FRP is that it comes in standard sizes, which can be ordered in bulk and stored until needed.</p>
